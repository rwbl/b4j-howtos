# B4J HowTos
Whilst learning and exploring [B4J - RAD development tool for cross platform desktop, server and IoT solutions](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html), captured **HowTos** (over 1000 in the mean time) and build more then 200 sample projects.
The **HowTos** are either from own experience or inspired by hints from the B4J forum.

_Please note_: the **HowTos** are not regularly updated, means information might not cover solutions possible with the latest B4J version (see also [B4J Forum](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4j-howtos.36350/)).
Tested with B4J v6.30 and JDK8.

## Archive
The **HowTos** are stored in the archive b4jhowto20180607.zip.
This archive does not contain the archives of the sample projects. Please request a sample project via [email](mailto:rwblinn@outlook.de).

## Install
Unzip the archive to a folder of choice and open index.htm.

## Notes
Issue displaying the HTML pages with some browsers. The index displays the topics, but not the content. It is possible to search through the html files and then display them. But the index.htm as a table of contents can notbe used.
it works with Firefox (Quantum browser engine), but not with Chrome, Opera or Torch browser's or any other using the Blink browser engine.
