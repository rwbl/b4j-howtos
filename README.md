# B4J HowTos
While learning and exploring [B4J - RAD development tool for cross platform desktop, server and IoT solutions](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html), captured B4J HowTos (over 1000) and build more then 200 sample projects.
The B4J HowTos are either from own experience or inspired by hints from the B4J forum.
Please note, due to other commitments, the B4J HowTos are not regularly updated, information might not cover solutions possible with the latest B4J version (see also [B4J Forum](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4j-howtos.36350/)).


## Archive
The B4J HowTos are stored in the archive b4jhowto20180607.zip.
This archive does not contain the sample projects. Please request via [email](mailto:rwblinn@outlook.de).

## Install
Unzip the archive to a folder of choice and open index.htm.

## Notes
Issue displaying the HTML pages with some browsers. The index displays the topics, but not the content. It is possible to search through the html files and then display them. But the index.htm as a table of contents can notbe used.
it works with Firefox (Quantum browser engine), but not with Chrome, Opera or Torch browser's or any other using the Blink browser engine.
