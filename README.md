# B4J HowTos
Whilst learning and exploring [B4J - RAD development tool for cross platform desktop, server and IoT solutions](https://www.b4x.com/b4j.html), captured **B4J HowTos** (over 1000) and build more then 200 sample projects.
The **B4J HowTos** are either from own experience or inspired by hints from the B4J forum.

_Please note_:
* The **B4J HowTos** are not regularly updated, means information might not cover solutions possible with the latest B4J version (see also [B4J Forum](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4j-howtos.36350/)).
* Created with B4J v6.30 and Oracle Java JDK8.
* The **B4J HowTos** have been created for **personal use**  only. If planned for commercial use, ensure to comply to the [Oracle JDK License Agreement](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/javase-license.html). 

## Version
* 20180607

## Archives
* The **B4J HowTos** are stored in the archive **b4jhowto20180607.zip**.
* Selective sample projects in folder **sampleprojects**.

## Install
Unzip the archive **b4jhowto20180607.zip** to a folder of choice and open **index.htm** in a browser.

## Notes
Issue displaying the HTML pages with some browsers. The index displays the topics, but not the content. It is possible to search through the html files and then display them. But the index.htm as a table of contents can not be used.
It works with Firefox (Quantum browser engine), but not with Chrome, Opera or Torch browser's or any other using the Blink browser engine.
